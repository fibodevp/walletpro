# Multisig Wallet Contract

## Overview

This Solidity contract implements a multisignature wallet, allowing multiple owners to control the funds. It requires a predefined number of confirmations from owners to execute transactions. This adds an extra layer of security for managing funds in a decentralized manner.

## Features

- **Multisignature functionality**: Requires a set number of confirmations to execute transactions.
- **Transaction management**: Owners can submit, confirm, execute, and revoke transactions.
- **Security**: Helps prevent unauthorized transactions by requiring multiple approvals.

## Prerequisites

- **Solidity version**: This contract is written in Solidity 0.8.x.
- **Development environment**: You can use Remix IDE or any Ethereum development framework like Truffle or Hardhat.

## How to Deploy

1. Open the contract in your preferred development environment.
2. Make sure you have the required `owners` and `requiredConfirmations` parameters.
3. Deploy the contract.

### Example Deployment

To deploy the contract, you can use the following JavaScript snippet in a testing framework like Hardhat:

```javascript
const MultisigWallet = artifacts.require("MultisigWallet");

async function deploy() {
    const owners = ["0xYourAddress1", "0xYourAddress2", "0xYourAddress3"];
    const requiredConfirmations = 2;
    
    const multisigWallet = await MultisigWallet.new(owners, requiredConfirmations);
    console.log("MultisigWallet deployed at:", multisigWallet.address);
}

deploy();
